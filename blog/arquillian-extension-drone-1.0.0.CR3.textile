h3. Some of the highlights in this release

Upgraded underlying *Selenium* to 2.13.0

Fixed cleanup for method scoped browsers

*Improved WebDriver configuration*, now you're able to switch between browser implementations using arquillian.xml configuration only:

bc(prettify). @Drone WebDriver driver;

bc(prettify).. <property name="implementationClass">
  org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver
</property>

p. now behaves the same way as:

bc(prettify). @Drone FirefoxDriver driver;
