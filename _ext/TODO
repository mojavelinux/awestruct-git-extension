* push my site to openshift
* bootstrap into sarah's branch
* integrate new backend into sarah's branch

* url for component should link to documentation

* abstract modules for Visitors and Crawlers
* jira component url on component
* show test enrichers and protocol for container adapters (perhaps composite template to fill in middle?)
* # of commits per release (commits => {:authors => [], :count => 0}
* when identities.yml is deleted, but not components.yml, we get no contributors listed
* identities
  * decide whether username == github_id or what username really is
  * not linking component leads to identities cleanly (most of the way there w/ search by jboss_username & username)
  * enhance identities?
  * emails helper method in identities
  * time zone (twitter gives us this)
  * show on map (ohloh gives us lat, long)
* build status on module pages
* cleanup component name like we did w/ module name
* use modal dialog to show contributor list per release (or the count), release notes, etc
* use modal dialog to contributor bio
* if not arquillian-core, add note to refer to arquillian-core page to setup arquillian
* primary org idea? to separate out auxiliary/external commits?
  - perhaps core and external based on whether repository owner is arquillian?
* rename modules to modules_by_type or some other way of organizing; perhaps using extend w/ methods
* family needs to be capitialized (may need a mapping here, cause we got some tricky stuff)
  - get "pretty" family by looking after Arquillian and before Managed|Embedded|Remote
* mapping for component type...perhaps do magic on visitor name?
* two columns on modules page perhaps?
* link to containers in family (perhaps with pills)
* TomDoc!! http://tomdoc.org/
* twitter bootstrap badges and inverse labels were fixed (apply to stylesheet)
* define max_version for container if another is detected w/ a higher min_version
* RestClient enhancer that detects request for application/xml and parses to REXML::Document

try on forge or shrinkwrap?

== Tips/Tricks

* ||=
* use --no-generate for quick startup of awestruct

== Partially done

* TomEE <- need more flexibility in tag regex & not capturing arquillian core version
  /^(openejb-)?[1-9]\d*\.\d+\.\d+[\.-]((alpha|beta|cr)-?[1-9]\d*|final)$/
  - https://github.com/apache/openejb/tree/trunk/openejb/arquillian-tomee
* don't overwrite identity info if new value is shorter (for things like bio and location) <- for now just disabled overwrite
* fork button (added, but may need tweeking)
** https://github.com/markdotto/github-buttons <- should host in the site (perhaps a good awestruct extension)
